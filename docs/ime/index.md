## IME Support

Hapan was originally designed to help **Han Chinese learn Kazakh** and **type Kazakh on PC**, so the support of input method is of far-reaching significance to Happin project.

Hapin's input method support is based on [Rime](https://rime.im) (the open source project with `GPL- 3.0` license) provides support for typing on the PC side of the Kazakh language.

> You can learn how to use by visiting [Hapin Rime Scheme Using Guide](https://ha-pin.github.io/ime-guide).

Now we support Hapin schemes for IME as followed:

| Name                                   | URL                                                        | Description                         | License   |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------- |
| [Hapin Arabic](./ime/hapin-arabic)     | [hapin-arabic](https://github.com/ha-pin/hapin-arabic)     | For **The Persian-Arabic Alphabet** | `GPL-3.0` |
| [Hapin Cyrillic](./ime/hapin-cyrillic) | [hapin-cyrillic](https://github.com/ha-pin/hapin-cyrillic) | For **The Cyrillic Alphabet**       | `GPL-3.0` |

> **TODO** With the Latinization reform in Kazakhstan, Kazakhstan has a plan to support it, but it is not yet stable.
